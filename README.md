This report shows the company's targeting and retention efforts of consumer data presented in this report. Data on consumer demographics, purchase patterns, and campaign engagement are all included in the dataset


# Overview

Numerous important insights are revealed by the investigation, which can aid the business in maximizing its efforts to attract and retain customers. The business can promote long-term growth and optimize return on investment by matching its marketing and product development tactics with the traits and actions of its target market.


This analysis's main objectives are:

-Determine which new customer segments the business should focus on selling its expensive products to.

-Ascertain which clients the business can depend on to provide continuous revenue.

-Determine which current clients are not likely to gain much from targeted efforts so that the business can concentrate its resources on other promising markets.

-Identify new clients who need to have their long-term potential carefully assessed to avoid them becoming unproductive or having low-value.

-Divide the consumer base into discrete groups according to how they spend their money and learn about the traits of the most ardent consumers of particular product categories, like meat.

By focusing on these objectives, the business may create more successful client acquisition and retention plans, resulting in long-term profitability and growth.
